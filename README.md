# 🪐 Orbital Gravity Simulator

A sandbox-style orbital simulator where you can place gravity sources (e.g., yellow, white, and red dwarfs) and add particles like satellites, planetoids, and terrestrial planets. Particles orbit around gravity sources, and mutual gravitation can be enabled so particles affect each other’s trajectories.

<br />This project focuses on creating an interactive and visual playground for experimenting with orbital mechanics, rather than striving for strict astrophysical accuracy.

## 🚧 Status
This project is currently in development and not yet feature-complete. Future plans include:
- Adjustable gravity strength and mass for bodies
- More particle types and visual styles
- Saving/loading simulations
- A Solar System model that can be used as a template for your sandbox.
